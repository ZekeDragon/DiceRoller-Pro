# Simple Qt Dice Roller Application
First in a series of Weekend Projects by Ezekiel Oruven/KirHut Software.

The Simple Qt Dice Roller Application is meant to be an example application showing a quick example application written
using Qt 6. This example application is **not** an example of the best software that KirHut Software company can
develop, instead, it is meant to be something that can be quickly and easily digested to see how source code by KirHut
is written and provide useful examples of how to develop small applications with Qt.

This example application should be regularly updated with small extensions or improvements of the UI over time, but
will not extend far beyond the already existing code base. This is because it is meant to serve as an *example*, which
would be undermined by continuous code changes and increasing complexity.

This code is released in the hope that it will be useful for new C++ developers looking to understand how to develop
applications using Qt.
